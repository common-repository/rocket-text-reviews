== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I filter which reviews I want appearing on my site? =

Not at this time. However, we are actively developing additional features. What you can do it filter how many reviews you would like to show by using the reviewCount="1" parameter, and you can choose which reviews to start with by using the reviewStart="1" parameter (this is best used as pagination)

= Can I display reviews from other third party sites like Google? =

Unfortunately not. To avoid duplicate reviews across the internet we only display Rocket Text Reviews on your website.
